**NUSBuses** ([nusbuses.com](nusbuses.com)) is a shuttle bus tracker app for the National University of
 Singapore (NUS) community.

## Features
- Service route map
- Live bus location tracking
- Bus timings tracking
- Favorite list


## What NUSBuses has (and NUS NextBus doesn't):
- **Blazing fast** (Remember waiting forever for the NextBus app to load?)
    - We use Google's infrastructure and sophisticated cache technology to deliver you a fast and reliable user experience.
- **Web app** (No download needed!)
    - NUSBuses runs on your browser and is cross-platform.
- **Delightful and easy-to-use user interface** (We understand your pain when you just can't find what you need on NextBus app.)
    -  We made our best effort to make NUSBuses powerful yet super intuitive.
- **Care about you privacy**
  - We never ask for any permission (GPS and so on) unless the user chooses the service.
    
## Feedback
We welcome bug reports and feature requests. Thank you for making NUSBuses better!
