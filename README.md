**NUSBuses** ([nusbuses.com](nusbuses.com)) is a shuttle bus tracker app for the National University of
 Singapore (NUS) community. It has a 
simple and delightful look, and is blazing fast. 

## Features
- Service route map
- Live bus location tracking
- Bus timings tracking
- Favorite list


## What NUSBuses has (and NUS NextBus doesn't):
- **Blazing fast** (Remember waiting forever for the NextBus app to load?)
    - We use Google's infrastructure and sophisticated cache technology to deliver 
    you fast and reliable user experience.
- **Web app** (No download needed!)
    - NUSBuses runs on your browser and is cross-platform.
- **Delightful and easy-to-use user interface** (We understand your pain when you just 
can't find what you need on NextBus app.)
    -  We made our best effort to make NUSBuses powerful yet super intuitive.
